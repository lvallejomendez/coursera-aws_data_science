    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Autopilot automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression, based on your data while allowing to maintain full control and visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Autopilot will inspect the raw dataset, apply feature processors, pick the best set of algorithms, train and tune multiple models, and then rank the models based on performance - all with just a few clicks.  Autopilot transparently generates a set of Python scripts and notebooks for a complete end-to-end pipeline including including data analysis, candidate generation, feature engineering, and model training/tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Autopilot job consists of the following high-level steps: \n",
    "* _Data analysis_ where the data is summarized and analyzed to determine which feature engineering techniques, hyper-parameters, and models to explore.\n",
    "* _Feature engineering_ where the data is scrubbed, balanced, combined, and split into train and validation.\n",
    "* _Model training and tuning_ where the top performing features, hyper-parameters, and models are selected and trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/autopilot-transparent.png\" width=\"100%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "These re-usable scripts and notebooks give us full visibility into how the model candidates were created.  Since Autopilot integrates natively with SageMaker Studio, we can visually explore the different models generated by SageMaker Autopilot.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Autopilot can be used by people without machine learning experience to automatically train a model from a dataset.  Additionally, experienced developers can use Autopilot to train a baseline model from which they can iterate and manually improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autopilot is available through the SageMaker Studio UI and AWS Python SDK.  In this notebook, you will use the AWS Python SDK to train a series text-classification models and deploy the model with the highest accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on Autopilot, have a look at this [**Amazon Science Publication**](https://www.amazon.science/publications/amazon-sagemaker-autopilot-a-white-box-automl-solution-at-scale).\n",

    "### Use case: analyze customer sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer feedback appears across many channels including social media and partner websites.  As a company, you want to capture this valuable product feedback to spot negative trends and improve the situation, if needed. \n",
